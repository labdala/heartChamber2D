# heartChamber2D

This algorithm was developed during my Master's studies at the University of Campinas, SP, Brazil. 

This work has been published in my master thesis, titled "Heart chamber modeling using Navier-Stokes equations: Modelo computacional de uma câmara do coração a partir das equações de Navier-Stokes", and can be found at [https://doi.org/10.47749/T/UNICAMP.2018.1080794](https://doi.org/10.47749/T/UNICAMP.2018.1080794). 
We also have submitted a manuscript to a journal, and it is currently under review.
